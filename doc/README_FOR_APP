Instructions: 

Before running the app you should get all the changes that have been made since you last used it. You start by opening the Terminal application and typing the command: 
./deploy.sh

To start the app server so you can see it on your browser type the command: 
./server.sh

The app will be available when you point your browser to http://localhost:3000 (bookmarked in chrome)

You stop the server by typing the command: 
./server_stop.sh

You should stop the server when you're done editing as running the server will drain your battery and use processing power. 

When you're finished with your changes and want to see them on the actual website type the command: 
./deploy.sh

This will make changes to the website in production so proceed with caution, don't do this if something is broken. 

**If this doesn't work you should try typing the command: 
cd

This will take you to your home directory where the scripts are stored. 

A .sh script is just a set of commands typed into the terminal, you can open a script in textmate to see which commands it executes. 

You can use the gitx application to keep track of changes- if you refresh it you will be able to see which files I have changed since you last logged in and what files you have changed as well.
